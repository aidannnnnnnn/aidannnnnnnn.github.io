# aidannnnnnnn.github.io

Welcome to my Portfolio! This is the GitHub repo for the code I used to make the portfolio, which you are welcome to read, use and learn from. 

# How this project was made
I developed this webpage using prior knowledge and experience of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, thus providing a glimpse into my Web Development skills. 

This project has 3 pages: 
- **index.html**: the Home page of the portfolio website
- **about.html**: a page to learn more about me as a person!
- **projects.html**: this goes into detail about the projects that I have completed both from University and personal development. Clicking on each link in this page will take you to the Github Repository for that project. This page will be updated for each new project that I add to my portfolio. 

# Viewing the webpage
You can view my portfolio on the internet by following the link here: [aidannnnnnnn.github.io](https://aidannnnnnnn.github.io)

# Running this locally
To run this locally, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. Ensure that you are in the aidannnnnnnn.github.io folder, and open any of the HTML files in your browser of choice. 

# Disclaimer
Please note that as mentioned above, this page will be updated for each new project that I add to my portfolio. In addition, I will aim to improve this webpage over time, possibly integrating an idea that I had to add three.js features to make this portfolio more unique and interactive.
