Welcome to my Portfolio! This is the GitHub repo for the code I used to make the portfolio, which you are welcome to read, use and learn from. 

# How this project was made
I developed this webpage using prior knowledge and experience of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, thus providing a glimpse into my Web Development skills. 

This project has 4 pages: 
- **index.html**: the Home page of the portfolio website
- **about.html**: a page to learn more about me as a person!
- **projects.html**: this goes into detail about the projects that I have completed both from University and personal development. Clicking on each link in this page will take you to the Github Repository for that project.  This page will be updated for each new project that I add to my portfolio.
