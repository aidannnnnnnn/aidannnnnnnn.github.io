        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I am Aidan, a third year Bachelor of Advanced Computing student based in Sydney, studying at the University of Sydney, majoring in Cybersecurity and Data Science. Within my degree, I have strategically focused my coursework in the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>Usability and Security of Computing</li>
            <li>Software Development and its practices, such as the Agile and Scrum methodologies.</li>
            <li>Data Science, Big Data, Data Analytics and Scalable Data and Information Management</li>
            <li>Distributed Systems, Operating Systems and Network Platforms</li>
            <li>Systems, Object Oriented Programming and Web Development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Alongside the above, I am always interested in continuous professional development - learning, applying and utilising new skills to become a more complete person and improve my brand.</p>
        <p>I have a keen interest in numerous hobbies, such as playing and watching sports (notably cricket, basketball, football and tennis), cooking and trying food from different cultures and understanding our economy through a range of diverse perspectives.</p>
